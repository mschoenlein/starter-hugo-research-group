        ##<br>I am a vision scientist studying visual reasoning through a psychological and visualization lens. Specifically, I have been investigating how people learn associations between colors and concepts from their experiences in the world, and how those associations then influence our interpretations of information visualizations. I am a 6th year PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I work with Karen Schloss in the Visual Reasoning lab as part of the Department of Psychology and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery.
